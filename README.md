## Reflection ðŸ§ 
Throughout the UTMDigital visit, I learned a lot. It was highly interesting and beneficial. The talk was well-organized, engaging, and provided students with valuable knowledge. It sparked my interest in digital technology and its real-world applications. Activities such as visiting the open office and the smartboard meeting room were interactive and enhanced my understanding of the course material. Moreover, the UTMDigital staff were incredibly supportive and highly knowledgeable, especially En. Fairuz, whom we interviewed thus, making the experience both enjoyable and educational. Overall, this visit deepened my learning and provided valuable insights into the digital industry.
